The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.

The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage. This was only invented in the last few hundred years. It started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it’s really blown up with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.

What is emotion? Although the research literature offers a plethora of definitions (Kleinginna & Kleinginna, 1981), two generally agreed-upon aspects of emotion stand out: 1) emotion is a reaction to events deemed relevant to the needs, goals, or concerns of an individual; and, 2) emotion encompasses physiological, affective, behavioral, and cognitive components

Emotion can be distinguished from mood by its object-directedness. As Frijda (1994) explains, emotions are intentional: They “imply and involve relationships with a particular object.” We get scared of something, angry at someone, and excited about some event. Moods, on the other hand, though they may be indirectly caused by a particular object, are “nonintentional”; they are not directed at any object in particular and are thus experienced as more diffuse, global, and general. A person can be sad about something (an emotion) or generally depressed (a mood). Unfortunately, the English language often allows the same term to describe both emotion and mood (e.g., “happy”

Another distinction between emotion and mood emerges from a functional perspective. As a reaction to a particular situation, emotions bias action—they prepare the body and the mind for an appropriate, immediate response. As such, emotions also tend to be relatively short-lived. Moods, in contrast, tend to bias cognitive strategies and processing over a longer term (Davidson, 1994). More generally, moods can be seen to serve as a background affective filter through which both internal and external events are appraised. A person in a good mood tends to view everything in a positive light, while a person in a bad mood does the opposite. The interaction between

emotions and moods is also important. Moods tend to bias which emotions are experienced, lowering the activation thresholds for mood-related emotions. Emotions, on the other hand, often cause or contribute to moods.

Sentiment Sentiment is also often confused with emotion. Unlike emotions (and moods), sentiments are not states of an individual, but assigned properties of an object. When a person says that they “like” an interface or find an interface to be “frustrating,” what they really mean is that that they associate the interface with a positive or frustrating emotional state; in other words, they expect interaction with the interface to lead to positive or frustrating emotions. The basis for this judgment often comes from direct experience and subsequent generalization, but may also arise from social learning

11 Emotion in Human-Computer Interaction One reason for the confusion between emotions and sentiment is that many languages use the same words for both. For example, the word “like” can be used both to indicate prediction or opinion (sentiment) as well as a current emotional state (e.g. “I like receiving email” vs. “I like the email that just arrived”). Clore (1994, p. 108) offers an interesting explanation for this ambiguity, theorizing that sentiments are judged by bringing the object to mind and observing the affective reaction. But, while emotions and moods are fleeting—emotions lasting only seconds and moods lasting for hours or even days—sentiments can persist indefinitely and are thus responsible for guiding our propensities to seek out or avoid particular objects and situations. In this sense, sentiments are of critical importance for HCI because they motivate users to return to particular software products or websites.

Although direct interaction with an object is the most accurate way for a user to create a sentiment—consider the colloquial phrase, “how do you know you don’t like it unless you try it”—sentiments can also be caused by assumptions based on the communicated properties of an object. A person may, for example, base a sentiment on someone else’s description of their interaction with the object, or even immediately adopt the sentiment of someone they know or respect (e.g., consider the presumed influence of celebrities in software advertisements). As a predictive construct, sentiments are often generalizations about a class of objects with a given recognizable property, i.e., stereotypes. Although some of these generalizations may be logical and accurate, others may not—in fact, they may not even be conscious. Negative experiences with a particular computer character, for example, may lead users to conclude that they dislike all character-based interfaces. However, using a character that people know and like already—Mickey Mouse, for example—may be able to leverage sentiment to an interface’s advantage. Similarly, many people have well-established sentiments regarding certain types of applications, e.g. “I hate spreadsheet applications.”
